# Chat
A simple chat website made with express.

# Simply run the code and it will work!
If you want to use the default code only, I highly recommend editing it, because anyone can send HTML messages (using <b> and etc) and send messages without a username using `web/send?message=message`.

# The chat reset?
Yes. The chat resets every 1 hour.

# How do I remove spam messages?
You can do it by editing `chat.txt` and actually code rate limits and other things.
